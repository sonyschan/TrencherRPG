# Welcome to IdleTrencher

**Make your token wallet fun and cute!**

## Why IdleTrencher?

Let's be honest — watching crypto charts can be stressful. The constant price swings, the FOMO, the red days that never seem to end...

**What if checking your portfolio could actually be... relaxing?**

**IdleTrencher** brings visual, gamified creativity to crypto. Instead of staring at boring numbers and anxiety-inducing charts, your tokens come to life as adorable 3D characters that react to the market in real-time.

- **Token going up?** Your character celebrates with a happy dance!
- **Having a rough day?** They're doing sit-ups, working hard to recover.
- **Market's chill?** They're just taking a peaceful stroll.

## The Vibe

IdleTrencher is designed for **crypto enjoyers**. Whether you're a diamond-handed holder or just curious about your friend's portfolio, we want to make the experience:

- **Fun** — An idle game where your tokens become characters
- **Relaxing** — No more chart anxiety, just cute characters vibing
- **Engaging** — Gamified leveling, skins, and leaderboards

> "I used to check my portfolio 50 times a day out of stress. Now I check it 50 times a day because I want to see my little guys dance." — *Probably someone*

## Getting Started

1. **Connect your wallet** — We support Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana wallets
2. **Watch your tokens come alive** — Your top holdings become 3D partners
3. **Level them up** — Just by holding, your partners gain EXP and grow stronger

# Gameplay

## Your Home Base

When you connect your wallet, your top token holdings transform into **Partners** — cute 3D characters that live in your personal plaza.

### Meet Your Partners

Each token in your wallet becomes a partner character. They're not just standing there looking pretty — they actually **react to the market** in real-time!

| Market Condition | Character Behavior |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Price going up | Happy dance & celebration |
| Price going down | Doing sit-ups (working hard!) |
| Price stable | Peaceful walking around |

Click on any partner to chat with them. They'll tell you:
- How they're doing today (24h price change)
- Their HP status (based on your entry point)
- How long you've been together

*Who knows? Maybe in the future, they'll have even more stories to share with you...*

### HP Bars — Your Visual Progress

Every partner has an **HP bar** that shows how your investment is doing compared to your base value.

- **Green bars** = You're in profit!
- **Red bars** = Currently below your base value

**Pro tip:** You can **Edit Base Value** to set your own entry point. This is useful if you want to track gains from a specific price, not just when you first connected.

### EXP & Levels

Your partners gain **experience points (EXP)** just by being in your portfolio. The longer you hold, the stronger they become!

#### How EXP Works

- **1 day holding** = 1 EXP (roughly)
- **Bonus EXP**: When your token is pumping (price increasing), you gain bonus hours toward EXP
- **Max Level**: 60 (achieved after about 1 year of holding)

**Warning:** If a partner is removed from your portfolio — whether you sold the token or its value dropped below other holdings — their EXP will be reset to zero.

> The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single day of holding. Or something like that.

### The Interface

Here's what you'll see on your home screen:

- **3D Plaza** — Your partners walking, dancing, or exercising
- **Wallet Value** — Your total portfolio value at a glance
- **Partner Count** — How many tokens you're tracking
- **Refresh Button** — Update your portfolio data

The number of partners you can have depends on how much **$IDLE** token you hold.

## Explore Other Wallets

Ever wondered what your favorite crypto influencer is actually holding? Or maybe you want to check out a friend's portfolio in a fun way?

**Explore mode** lets you peek into any public Solana wallet and see their tokens as 3D characters!

### How It Works

1. Click the **Explore** button (magnifying glass icon)
2. Paste any Solana wallet address
3. Watch their portfolio come alive!

### What You Can See

When exploring someone else's wallet, you'll see:

- Their token partners as 3D characters
- Approximate portfolio value
- How each token is performing (dancing vs exercising)

**Privacy First:** We only show **public blockchain data** — the same information anyone can see on a block explorer, just way more fun to look at. No private data, no tracking.

### Fun Use Cases

**Alpha Hunting:** See what smart money is holding. If their characters are all dancing, maybe they're onto something...

**Show Friends:** Share your wallet address and let friends see your portfolio in style. Way cooler than sending a screenshot!

**Learning:** New to crypto? Explore wallets of experienced traders to see what a diversified portfolio looks like.

## Character Skins

*Coming Soon: This feature is currently in development.*

### What Are Skins?

Right now, your partners are assigned random villager-style characters. But soon, you'll be able to **customize their appearance** with unique skins!

### Planned Features

**Skin Collection:**
- **Basic Skins** — Free for everyone (villagers, adventurers)
- **Premium Skins** — Knights, mages, archers, and more
- **Legendary Skins** — Ultra-rare designs for dedicated holders

**How to Unlock:**

| Method | Skins |
|--------|-------|
| Level Up | Reach certain levels to unlock skins |
| Hold $IDLE | Exclusive skins for token holders |
| Contribute | Artists who create skins get free access |

**Assign to Favorites:** Once unlocked, you can assign any skin to your favorite tokens. Imagine your main bag rocking a legendary knight skin while surrounded by a squad of mages!

### For Artists: Create Your Own Skin!

We're building IdleTrencher as a community project, and we'd love your contributions.

If you're a **3D artist**, you can create character skins that get added to the game. Contributors automatically get to use their own creations!

**Requirements:**
- Rigged 3D model compatible with our animation system
- Multiple animation states (walk, run, celebrate, exercise)
- Family-friendly design

## Global Leaderboard

*Coming Soon: This feature is currently in development.*

### The Ultimate Flex

Sure, anyone can buy a token. But trading skills, sharp vision, and the ability to hold — it takes all three to be a true master. The leaderboard will showcase the most skilled Trenchers in the IdleTrencher community.

### How Rankings Work

We're designing the leaderboard to filter for the strongest Trenchers:

- Hold $IDLE to gain EXP boost advantages
- More partners + higher levels = higher total score
- Different asset tiers compete separately — small and big holders in their own leagues

### Why a Leaderboard?

Let's be real — crypto can be competitive. Instead of competing on who can trade the fastest or who got the earliest insider info, we want to celebrate a different kind of success:

**The ability to balance holding and active trading.**

It sounds simple, but in a world of 100x memecoins and daily rugs, being a consistent holder is its own achievement.

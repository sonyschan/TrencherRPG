# Your 3D Partners

When you connect your wallet, your top token holdings transform into **Partners** — cute 3D characters that live in your personal plaza and react to the market in real-time!

![Home Interface](/img/interface.jpg)

## Meet Your Partners

Each token in your wallet becomes a unique partner character. They're not just standing there looking pretty — they actually **react to market conditions**:

| Market Condition | Character Behavior |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 📈 Price going up | Happy dance & celebration |
| 📉 Price going down | Doing sit-ups (working hard!) |
| 😐 Price stable | Peaceful walking around |

## Partner Dialog

Click on any partner to chat with them! They'll tell you:

- How they're doing today (24h price change)
- Their HP status (based on your entry point)
- How long you've been together

*Who knows? Maybe in the future, they'll have even more stories to share with you... 💭*

## HP Bars — Your Visual Progress

Every partner has an **HP bar** that shows how your investment is doing compared to your base value.

- **Green bars** = You're in profit! 💚
- **Red bars** = Currently below your base value

:::tip Pro tip
You can **Edit Base Value** to set your own entry point. This is useful if you want to track gains from a specific price, not just when you first connected.

## Partner Slots

The number of partners you can have depends on your **$IDLE** holdings:

| $IDLE Held | Partner Slots |
|------------|---------------|
| 0 | 3 partners (free tier) |
| 10,000+ | 4 partners |
| 20,000+ | 5 partners |
| 70,000+ | 10 partners (max) |

See [Tokenomics](/tokenomics) for full details.

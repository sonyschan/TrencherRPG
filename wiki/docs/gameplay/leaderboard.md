## The Ultimate Flex

Sure, anyone can buy a token. But can you **hold** it? The leaderboard will showcase the most dedicated holders in the IdleTrencher community.

## Planned Categories

### 💎 Diamond Hands
Rankings based on **total holding time** across all your partners. The longer you've held, the higher you climb.

### ⭐ Level Masters
Who has the highest-level partners? Show off your legendary companions that have been with you through thick and thin.

### 📈 Profit Kings
Track performance while holding. Not just who made gains, but who made gains **while actively holding** in IdleTrencher.

### 🎯 Diversification Award
Recognition for well-balanced portfolios. Because putting all your eggs in one basket is so 2021.

## How Rankings Work

We're designing the leaderboard to reward **genuine holders**, not just people who connect once and forget:

- Regular activity in IdleTrencher will be factored in
- Partner levels matter more than raw holdings
- Anti-gaming measures to keep it fair

## Prizes & Recognition

We're exploring ways to reward top leaderboard participants:

- 🏅 Special profile badges
- 🎨 Exclusive skins
- 🪙 $IDLE token rewards
- 🎉 Community shoutouts

## Why a Leaderboard?

Let's be real — crypto can be competitive. Instead of competing on who can trade the fastest or who got the earliest insider info, we want to celebrate a different kind of success:

**The ability to hold with conviction.**

It sounds simple, but in a world of 100x memecoins and daily rugs, being a consistent holder is its own achievement.

> "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."
> — Warren Buffett (who would probably not understand memecoins, but the principle stands)

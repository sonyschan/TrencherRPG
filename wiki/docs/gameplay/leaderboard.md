## The Ultimate Flex

Sure, anyone can buy a token. But trading skills, sharp vision, and the ability to hold — it takes all three to be a true master. The leaderboard will showcase the most skilled Trenchers in the IdleTrencher community.

## How Rankings Work

We're designing the leaderboard to filter for the strongest Trenchers:

- Hold $IDLE to gain EXP boost advantages
- More partners + higher levels = higher total score
- Different asset tiers compete separately — small and big holders in their own leagues

## Why a Leaderboard?

Let's be real — crypto can be competitive. Instead of competing on who can trade the fastest or who got the earliest insider info, we want to celebrate a different kind of success:

**The ability to balance holding and active trading.**

It sounds simple, but in a world of 100x memecoins and daily rugs, being a consistent holder is its own achievement.

> "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."
> — Warren Buffett (who would probably not understand memecoins, but the principle stands)

# Leaderboard & Rankings

import Admonition from '@theme/Admonition';

<Admonition type="caution" title="Coming Soon">

## The Ultimate Flex

Sure, anyone can buy a token. But trading skills, sharp vision, and the ability to hold — it takes all three to be a true master. The leaderboard will showcase the most skilled Trenchers in the community.

## How Rankings Work

Your **total score** is calculated by summing the levels of all your partner characters:

```
Total Score = Sum of All Partner Levels
```

For example:
- Partner 1: Lv15
- Partner 2: Lv12
- Partner 3: Lv8
- **Total Score: 35**

### Bonus Mechanics (In Design)

We're designing additional scoring bonuses to reward various achievements:

- 🎯 **Diversity Bonus** — Balanced portfolio across multiple tokens
- 💎 **Diamond Hands** — Extra points for long-term consistent holding
- 🚀 **Growth Bonus** — Rewards for partners that leveled up recently
- 🎨 **Skin Collection** — Bonus for unlocking rare skins

*Exact bonus formulas will be announced before launch.*

## League System

Different asset tiers compete in their own leagues — ensuring fair competition:

| League | Portfolio Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Bronze | < $1,000 |
| Silver | $1,000 - $10,000 |
| Gold | $10,000 - $100,000 |
| Diamond | $100,000+ |

This way, small and large holders each have their own competition space.

## Why a Leaderboard?

Let's be real — crypto can be competitive. Instead of competing on who can trade the fastest or who got the earliest insider info, we want to celebrate a different kind of success:

**The ability to balance holding and active trading.**

It sounds simple, but in a world of 100x memecoins and daily rugs, being a consistent holder is its own achievement.

> "The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient."
> — Warren Buffett (who would probably not understand memecoins, but the principle stands)

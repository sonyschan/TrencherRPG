# Skin System

Customize your partners with unique character skins! Different tiers unlock different visual styles.

## Skins in Development

We're actively developing new 3D character models. Here's a preview of upcoming **Gold tier** skins:

<div style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', gap: '20px', flexWrap: 'wrap'}}>
  <img src="/img/knight.png" alt="Knight" style={{width: '300px', borderRadius: '8px'}} />
  <img src="/img/mage.png" alt="Mage" style={{width: '300px', borderRadius: '8px'}} />
</div>

*Knight and Mage — Gold tier skins coming soon!*

## What Are Skins?

Right now, your partners are assigned random villager-style characters. But soon, you'll be able to **customize their appearance** with unique skins!

## Planned Features

### 🎭 Skin Collection
- **Basic Skins** — Free for everyone (villagers, adventurers)
- **Premium Skins** — Knights, mages, archers, and more
- **Legendary Skins** — Ultra-rare designs for dedicated holders

### 🔓 How to Unlock

We're exploring different ways to unlock skins:

| Method | Skins |
|--------|-------|
| Level Up | Reach certain levels to unlock skins |
| Hold $IDLE | Exclusive skins for token holders |
| Contribute | Artists who create skins get free access |

### 🎯 Assign to Favorites

Once unlocked, you can assign any skin to your favorite tokens. Imagine your main bag rocking a legendary knight skin while surrounded by a squad of mages!

## For Artists: Create Your Own Skin!

We're building IdleTrencher as a community project, and we'd love your contributions.

If you're a **3D artist**, you can create character skins that get added to the game. Contributors automatically get to use their own creations!

**Requirements:**
- Rigged 3D model compatible with our animation system
- Multiple animation states (walk, run, celebrate, exercise)
- Family-friendly design

Interested? Check out the [Community](/community#contribute-3d-characters) page for more details on how to contribute.

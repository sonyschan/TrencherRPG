# Skin System

Customize your partners with unique character skins! As your partners level up, they unlock access to more powerful and exclusive appearances.

![Skin Selection Interface](/img/skin-system.jpeg)

## How It Works

1. **Click on any partner** to open the Token Detail dialog
2. **Click "Change Skin"** button at the bottom
3. **Select from available skins** based on your partner's level
4. **Click Apply** to save your choice

## Skin Categories

### 🟤 Basic Skins (Level 1+)

Basic skins are available to all partners from the start. There's no restriction on how many partners can use the same basic skin.

| Skin | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Villager** | A humble villager ready for adventure |
| **Villager (Alt)** | Another hardworking villager |
| **Village Girl** | A cheerful village girl |
| **Village Girl (Alt)** | Another spirited village girl |

### 🏆 Premium Skins (Level-Gated + Exclusive)

Premium skins are **exclusive** — only **one partner per skin** within your wallet. When you assign a premium skin to a new partner, it will be automatically removed from the previous partner.

| Skin | Required Level | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| **Adventurer** | Level 3+ | A seasoned adventurer seeking treasure |
| **Lady** | Level 5+ | A noble lady of refined taste |
| **Mage** | Level 7+ | A powerful mage wielding arcane magic |
| **Knight** | Level 10+ | A valiant knight in shining armor |

## Rules & Restrictions

### Level Requirements

- Each skin has a **minimum level requirement**
- Locked skins appear grayed out with a 🔒 icon
- Once your partner reaches the required level, the skin unlocks

### 1:1 Exclusive Allocation (Premium Skins)

Premium skins follow a **1:1 rule**:

- Each premium skin can only be worn by **one partner at a time**
- If you assign a premium skin that's already in use, a confirmation dialog will appear
- The previous partner will revert to the default Villager skin

### What Happens When Tokens Are Sold?

- If you sell a token and later buy it back, the **skin assignment is preserved**
- However, if the token's level drops below the skin's requirement, it will fall back to a basic skin

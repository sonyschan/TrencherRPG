# Explore Other Wallets

Ever wondered what your favorite crypto influencer is actually holding? Or maybe you want to check out a friend's portfolio in a fun way?

**Explore mode** lets you peek into any public Solana wallet and see their tokens as 3D characters!

![Explore Mode](/img/explore.jpg)

## How It Works

1. Click the **Explore** button (magnifying glass icon)
2. Paste any Solana wallet address
3. Watch their portfolio come alive!

## What You Can See

When exploring someone else's wallet, you'll see:

- 🎭 Their token partners as 3D characters
- 💰 Approximate portfolio value
- 📊 How each token is performing (dancing vs exercising)

:::note Privacy First
We only show **public blockchain data** — the same information anyone can see on a block explorer, just way more fun to look at. No private data, no tracking.

## Fun Use Cases

### 🕵️ Alpha Hunting
See what smart money is holding. If their characters are all dancing, maybe they're onto something...

### 👥 Show Friends
Share your wallet address and let friends see your portfolio in style. Way cooler than sending a screenshot!

### 📚 Learning
New to crypto? Explore wallets of experienced traders to see what a diversified portfolio looks like.

## Coming Soon: Wallet Profiles

- Add a display name
- Show off your highest-level partners
- Track your all-time holding achievements

Stay tuned! 🔮

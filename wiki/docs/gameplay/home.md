# Your Home Base

When you connect your wallet, your top token holdings transform into **Partners** — cute 3D characters that live in your personal plaza.

![Home Interface](/img/interface.jpg)

## Meet Your Partners

Each token in your wallet becomes a partner character. They're not just standing there looking pretty — they actually **react to the market** in real-time!

| Market Condition | Character Behavior |
|------------------|-------------------|
| 📈 Price going up | Happy dance & celebration |
| 📉 Price going down | Doing sit-ups (working hard!) |
| 😐 Price stable | Peaceful walking around |

Click on any partner to chat with them. They'll tell you:
- How they're doing today (24h price change)
- Their HP status (based on your entry point)
- How long you've been together

*Who knows? Maybe in the future, they'll have even more stories to share with you... 💭*

## HP Bars — Your Visual Progress

Every partner has an **HP bar** that shows how your investment is doing compared to your base value.

- **Green bars** = You're in profit! 💚
- **Red bars** = Currently below your base value

:::tip Pro tip
You can **Edit Base Value** to set your own entry point. This is useful if you want to track gains from a specific price, not just when you first connected.

## EXP & Levels

Your partners gain **experience points (EXP)** just by being in your portfolio. The longer you hold, the stronger they become!

![EXP and Levels](/img/partners-exp-level.jpg)

### How EXP Works

- **Base Growth**: 1 EXP per hour (from holding time)
- **Bonus Growth**: Price increases grant extra EXP, rewarding active market participation
- **Max Level**: 60 (about 1 year of holding + moderate market activity)

### Level Milestones

| Level | Time Required |
|-------|---------------|
| Lv2 | ~10 hours |
| Lv10 | ~10 days |
| Lv20 | ~40 days |
| Lv30 | ~3 months |
| Lv60 | ~1 year (max) |

:::warning EXP Reset
If a partner drops out of your top holdings, their EXP resets. This design encourages a balanced strategy: steady holding for base growth, seizing price pumps for accelerated progress.

## The Interface

Here's what you'll see on your home screen:

- **3D Plaza** — Your partners walking, dancing, or exercising
- **Wallet Value** — Your total portfolio value at a glance
- **Partner Count** — How many tokens you're tracking
- **Refresh Button** — Update your portfolio data

The number of partners you can have depends on how much **$IDLE** token you hold. More on that in [Tokenomics](/tokenomics).

# Shareable OG Card

Share your IdleTrencher portfolio with style! When you share your wallet link on social media, a beautiful preview card is automatically generated.

## What is an OG Card?

OG (Open Graph) cards are the preview images that appear when you share a link on platforms like Twitter/X, Discord, Telegram, and other social media. IdleTrencher generates unique, eye-catching cards for your wallet.

## How It Works

1. **Get your share URL** using your wallet address
2. **Share it anywhere** — Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.
3. **Watch the magic** — A beautiful preview card appears automatically

### Share URL (For Social Media)

Use this URL for sharing on Twitter/X, Discord, Telegram:
```
https://idletrencher.xyz/api/share/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

For example:
```
https://idletrencher.xyz/api/share/9jwHJHSD7geYvTy6WUtoDVuuvuoJiWH2XHWMggPUpump
```

:::info Why use /api/share/?
Social platforms like Twitter need a webpage with special meta tags to display preview cards. The share URL provides this, then redirects visitors to your portfolio page.

### Direct Image URL

If you need the raw image (for embedding in websites or markdown):
```
https://idletrencher.xyz/api/og/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

## Card Features

The OG card includes:

- **Custom IdleTrencher branding** with GM/GN themed artwork
- **Dynamic wallet preview** showing your portfolio at a glance
- **Optimized dimensions** for all major platforms (1200x630)
- **Auto-generated** — no manual screenshot needed

## Themes

| Theme | Description |

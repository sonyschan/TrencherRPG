# Shareable OG Card

Share your IdleTrencher portfolio with style! When you share your wallet link on social media, a beautiful preview card is automatically generated.

## What is an OG Card?

OG (Open Graph) cards are the preview images that appear when you share a link on platforms like Twitter/X, Discord, Telegram, and other social media. IdleTrencher generates unique, eye-catching cards for your wallet.

## How It Works

1. **Get your OG card URL** using your wallet address
2. **Share it anywhere** — Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc.
3. **Watch the magic** — A beautiful preview card appears automatically

### OG Image URL

Your portfolio OG card is available at:
```
https://idletrencher.xyz/api/og/YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

For example:
```
https://idletrencher.xyz/api/og/9jwHJHSD7geYvTy6WUtoDVuuvuoJiWH2XHWMggPUpump
```

## Card Features

The OG card includes:

- **Custom IdleTrencher branding** with GM/GN themed artwork
- **Dynamic wallet preview** showing your portfolio at a glance
- **Optimized dimensions** for all major platforms (1200x630)
- **Auto-generated** — no manual screenshot needed

## Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **GM (Good Morning)** | Bright, energetic design for daytime sharing |
| **GN (Good Night)** | Calm, relaxed design for evening vibes |

2. **Tag us** — Mention [@idleTrencher](https://x.com/idleTrencher) for a chance to get featured

The OG card is cached for performance. If you want to refresh it after major portfolio changes, add a query parameter like `?v=2` to force regeneration.

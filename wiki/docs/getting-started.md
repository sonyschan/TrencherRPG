2. Select your preferred wallet from the Privy modal
3. Approve the connection in your wallet
4. Your tokens transform into partners!

## What Happens Next?

Once connected, IdleTrencher automatically:

- Scans your wallet for token holdings
- Transforms your top tokens into 3D partner characters
- Calculates your portfolio value
- Starts tracking EXP from your first visit

:::tip Mobile Users
